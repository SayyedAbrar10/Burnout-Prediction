# 🔥 Burnout Prediction using Linear Regression

A simple machine learning project using Linear Regression to predict employee burnout levels based on various features. The project uses a structured dataset and evaluates model performance through standard regression metrics.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 Burnout-Prediction/
├── Burnout_Linear_regression_model.ipynb
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Linear regression model implementation
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R² score
- Data visualization to support model insights

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset includes features related to employee satisfaction, workload, mental well-being, and more. Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded or embedded in the notebook.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

> For full details, refer to **Burnout_Linear_regression_model.ipynb**

## 📊 Model Performance

Model evaluation is done using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🧰 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayyedabrar/Burnout-Prediction.git
   cd Burnout-Prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Burnout_Linear_regression_model.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Try different regression algorithms (Ridge, Lasso, etc.)
- Add feature selection methods
- Integrate with real-time HR data dashboards
